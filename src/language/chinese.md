**Note**

Text box note. You need to wrap this whole thing with `---` and add a blank line between the end of your text block and the second `---` at the bottom. This adds a top and bottom horizontal line to wrap the box.

```json
{
  "firstName: "John",
  "lastName: "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

> You add this using '> textgoeshere' Similar to a quote.
